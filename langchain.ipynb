He became chairman of the board and later took on the role of CEO. He played a crucial role in shaping the company\\'s vision, design, and direction, and is widely recognized as the driving force behind Tesla\\'s success.\\n\\nOther key early employees who are sometimes referred to as \"co-founders\" due to their significant contributions include:\\n\\n*   **Ian Wright** (joined early 2004)\\n*   **JB Straubel** (joined mid-2004, crucial for battery and powertrain technology)\\n\\nDue to a legal settlement in 2009, Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning, Ian Wright, JB Straubel, and Elon Musk are all allowed to refer to themselves as \"co-founders\" of Tesla.\\n\\nSo, while **Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning** were the original founders who incorporated the company, **Elon Musk** is the most prominent and influential figure widely recognized as *the* founder due to his leadership, vision, and investment that transformed Tesla into what it is today.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'} id='lc_run--019aff06-9b28-7893-8f64-95ec10a92857-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 6, 'output_tokens': 964, 'total_tokens': 970, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 647}}\n"
